# SVG Logo Maker

## Description
This project was provided as a challenge to portray how developers need to provide some spice to their project to make it feel like it's an actual website. This was made in mind for developers with no artistic talents, and also an easy and quick method to get something started without taking to much time. Plus, it's free. This project was fully built from scratch.
